## Overview
This Python script generates a visual representation of the Sierpinski Triangle, a famous fractal named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. The script uses the Python Turtle graphics library to draw the fractal pattern.

## Features
Recursive Fractal Generation: The script uses a recursive function to create the Sierpinski Triangle pattern.
Customisable Parameters: Users can specify the side length and recursion depth to control the size and complexity of the fractal.
Requirements
Python 3.0

Turtle Graphics Library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Installation
No additional installation is required if Python 3.0 is already installed.

## Usage
Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment.

  `python fractals.py`


When prompted, enter the length of the side of the Sierpinski Triangle.
Enter the recursion depth for the fractal. Higher values will result in a more detailed pattern but may take longer to draw.
View the Fractal: The script will open a window displaying the Sierpinski Triangle.

## How It Works
- The script defines two main functions:

  - ``sierpinski_triangle(length, level)``: Draws the Sierpinski Triangle fractal.
  - ``draw_sierpinski(length, level)``: Sets up the drawing environment and initiates the fractal drawing process.
    
- The fractal is drawn using the Turtle graphics library, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphical patterns.
